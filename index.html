In fact,  we are dealing with a piece in which the musical material is transformed “by systematically “whiping it out”&rsquo; : “So apart from the quite banal initial material,  which we don't even know is &lsquo;initial material,&rsquo; the whole thing is in a whirlwind of dissolution even before it has been created”  (56),  and “which gives a certain plausibility to the concept of coherence which will later be destroyed”  (59).  In pace with Ferneyhough&rsquo;s piece,  our object will remain the same throughout,  whereas its ex&ndash;plication,  the modes of its “un&ndash;folding,” will explore diverse topologies.

        It is a phrase that is hurled at us at this very moment, when “austerity measures” &mdash; in a perverse appropiation of religious asceticism &mdash; “hurt” economies, and our wallets “hurt” in consonance. The discourse of “it hurts” at the same time attempts to erase its own traces: its perpetrators not only hide successfully behind the smokescreens of legal constructs, they are also &mdash; directly or indirectly &mdash; responsible for the ash grey clouds of facist movements that obfuscate the actuality of above measures &mdash; which, incidentally, are wholly without measure. In an attempt to read Cranach&rsquo;s painting in a contemporary mode, the following text will inspect the “European” custody in which St. Catherine seens to be held, suspend between divine redemption or merciless slaughter, captured at the moment the entire scene is threatened to be enveloped in its own toxic political fall-out. This inspection will take place through a reading of a cluster of texts of the philosopher Martin Heidegger, in an attempt to follow (and to be misled by) the multiple crossing lines of technology, the precariousness of humanity, and political commitment. We will depart in a mode, that Heidegger takes from Goethe: <u>Verwahrung</u>, both a safeguard and protest, a protection and erasure.

      <figcaption>In the works entitled “Fémur d’homme belge” and “Fémur de la femme française” (1964&ndash;65) Belgian artist Marcel Broodthaers show us two seemingly identical thigh bones painted in the colors of the Belgian and French national flags respectively. […] There is nothing in the materiality of the bones that suggests any such nationality &mdash; the dead know no state. And yet, military cemeteries are sacred sites of national identity, where the wounds, sufferings, and deaths of hundred and thousands are forced into posthumous color schemes and typographical schematics.</figcaption>

        Since Christ embraced the cross itself,  dare I<br>
        His image, th&rsquo;  image of His cross,  deny?<br>
        Would I have profit by the sacrifice,<br>
        And dare the chosen altar to despise?<br>
        It bore all other sins,  but is it fit<br>
        That it should bear the sin of scorning it?<br>
        Who from the picture would avert his eye,<br>
        How would he fly his pains,  who there did die?<br> 
        From me no pulpit,  nor misgrounded law,<br>
        Nor scandal taken,  shall this cross withdraw,<br>
        It shall not, for it cannot; for the loss<br>
        Of this cross were to me another cross.<br>
        Better were worse, far no affliction,<br>
        No cross is so extreme, as to have none.<br>
        Who can blot out the cross, with th&rsquo;  instrument<br>
        Of God dew&rsquo;d on me in the Sacrament?

          <h4>About the website</h4>
          <p>
            The website ‘Cross-Examinations’ is a translation of the book ‘Cross-Examinations’. It tries to convey the unique feeling I had while flipping through the book when I first hold it in hands.

          <h4>About the book</h4>
          <p>
            The book &ldquo;‘Cross-Examinations’ is an exercise in writing, erasing, and rewriting. Its four, increasingly layered iterations interrogate issues pertaining to torture, pain, and being. They engage a series of texts and works, such as an exchange between Heidegger and Jünger, poetry by John Donne and Jean Daive, a novel by Nachoem Wijnberg, Cranach’s ‘The Martyrdom of Saint Catherine’, Broodthaers’s ‘Fémur d’homme belge’ and ‘Fémur de la femme française’.&rdquo;
